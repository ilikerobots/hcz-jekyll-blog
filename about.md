I love writing software.  I like just thinking about software.  

I live in Tallinn, Estonia, a beautiful city in a remarkable country.

When I step away from the computer, I also enjoy:
 * Baseball; I play for the [Kostivere Amigos](https://et-ee.facebook.com/KostivereAmigos/); come join us or watch us!
 * Travel
 * Camping; see [Camp Estonia](http://www.campestonia.com/about)
 * Knot tying; I created the [Gersik knot](http://igkt.net/sm/index.php?topic=4178.0)
 * Weight-lifting

I am currently taking hiatus of the following hobbies:
 * Bread Baking
 * Reading
 
  
My online moniker is _ilikerobots_.
