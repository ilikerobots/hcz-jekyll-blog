I love writing software.  I like just thinking about software.  

I live in [Tallinn, Estonia](https://intallinn.ee), a beautiful city in a remarkable country.



When I step away from the computer, I also enjoy:

* Baseball; I play for the [Kostivere Amigos](https://et-ee.facebook.com/KostivereAmigos/); come join us or watch us!
* Travel
* Camping; see [Camp Estonia](http://www.campestonia.com/about)
* Bike Touring
* Edible Plants; see [Edible Plants of Estonia](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.starheightmedia.estoniaediblesmobile)
* Knot tying; I created the [Gersik knot](http://igkt.net/sm/index.php?topic=4178.0)

I am currently taking hiatus of the following hobbies:

* Bread Baking
* Reading
 
  
My online moniker is _ilikerobots_.
