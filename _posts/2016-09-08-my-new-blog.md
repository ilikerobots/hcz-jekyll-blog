I've been working recently in Dart and Polymer, both of which are young
and exciting projects.  The upside is that I'm exploring a 
new frontier of coding; but it seems at every step I get side-tracked
by solving a new minor problem.  

However, I've long ago learned that side-tracks, coding or otherwise,
are valuable and worthwhile.  Richard Feynman related how idle curiosity
about the motion of wobbling plates spinning in the air eventually led
him to win the Nobel Prize.  

I hope to document here some of my work along these tracks.  And while I'm 
not sure precisely where it will lead me, I do know it won't end in a Nobel Prize.
